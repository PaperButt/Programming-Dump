   <p>There is no reason for this dump to exist besides for me to share almost everything I've tried to create. I used Stack Overflow on some problems I had encoutered so most credits go to them. Dump 001 and 002 are illustrated here showing their workings as an example. <br>

   As you can see some of them are interactable with and others are more static.

   <p>The dumps are available for anyone to use as example personally or comercially, even this website but if you wanna give some credit i'll be very happy. Papa Bless and have fun exploring.</p>
