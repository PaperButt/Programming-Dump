    <p>There is no reason for this dump to exist besides for me to share almost everything I've tried to create. I used Stack Overflow on some problems I had encoutered so most credits go to them. Dump 001 and 002 are illustrated here showing their workings
      as an example. <br>

      <br> As you can see some of them are interactable with and others are more static.
    </p>
    <p>The dumps are available for anyone to use as example personally or comercially, even this website but if you wanna give some credit i'll be very happy. Papa Bless and have fun exploring.</p>
    <p> Links to dumps: <br> <a href="Programming Dump/HTML/001/index.html">Dump 001</a>
      <a href="Programming Dump/HTML/002/index.html">Dump 002</a>
      <a href="Programming Dump/HTML/003/index.html">Dump 003</a>
      <a href="Programming Dump/HTML/004/index.html">Dump 004</a> Have fun.
    </p>
    <p>P.S: The rest of the dumps are on the GitHub project <a href="https://github.com/PaperButt/Programming-Dump">https://github.com/PaperButt/Programming-Dump</a></p>
    <p>Also, if you want to access the dumps without downloading them or if they don't work as desired on your browser, it may be because of the cross-origin policy so here<br>
    all the links go as so <code>paperbutt.github.io/Programming-Dump/Programming-Dump/HTML/XXX/</code> where <i>XXX</i> is the number of the dump<br>
    I also put a nice little javascript here to help finding these and keep your adventure going:<br>
    Dump <input id="dump_input" type="text" name="dump" size="3.5" placeholder="000" style="font-size:18px;"> <button style="font-size: 18px; padding: 2px" id="dump_input_change" type="button" name="button" onclick="change_link()">Set</button> <br>
    <a href="#" id="dump_link"></a><br>
    Tip: Must have three numbers.
